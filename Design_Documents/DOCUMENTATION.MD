What is it your are going to build and how does it fit the theme?

The theme assigned to us was "Galactic Market". So we decided that it would be interesting to make a search engine for imaginary guns in an imaginary videogame. This fits the theme because these firearms are very sci-fi and futuristic and design and function. When this is done we will be able to filter through these guns by type, ammo, color, size, and availability.

What tools will you use?
