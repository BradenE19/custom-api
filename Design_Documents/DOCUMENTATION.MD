What is it your are going to build and how does it fit the theme?

The theme assigned to us was "Galactic Market". So we decided that it would be interesting to make a search engine for imaginary guns in an imaginary videogame. This fits the theme because these firearms are very sci-fi and futuristic and design and function. When this is done we will be able to filter through these guns by type, ammo, color, size, and availability.

What tools will you use?

With a project as big as this, naturally we will have quite a few tools we will need. Like every website, we will need a HTML and CSS file to display our gallery. For more complicated visuals on the page, we used bootstrap for laying out the contents and w3Schools for certain styles.

As for the back-end, first we required a database that could store and organize all the information for our guns. We used a MySql Database for this and we used VsCode to directly edit the necessary code. Javascript is the barebones of this project, as we have code that connects to the local server, extracts data to and from the database, generates cards for the guns, filters through the categories, etc.


How long do you expect to spend on development of each part?

This is fairly difficult to answer to be honest. Everyone has different issues and problems when going through code and that held true for us as well. However, we realized with the specifications the project asked for that most of our time and effort would be focused toward the backend as opposed to the frontend.
