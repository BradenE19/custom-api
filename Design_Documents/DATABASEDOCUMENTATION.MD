We used the MySql database for this project. In it, we have a table called 'gunstable' that lists the categories. Here is the code that creates the table as well as the categories inside it.

CREATE TABLE gunstable (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    gun_name VARCHAR(255),
    gun_img VARCHAR(255),
    type VARCHAR(255),
    size VARCHAR(255),
    colors VARCHAR(255),
    price VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    ammo VARCHAR(255),
    availability VARCHAR(255)
);

In order to get the proper info in the database, we needed to create a CSV file that lists each gun consistently. For example, here is the first 3 guns and how they are arranged.
